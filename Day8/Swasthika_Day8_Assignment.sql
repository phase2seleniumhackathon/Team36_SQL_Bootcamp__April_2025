--1.Create view vw_updatable_products (use same query whatever I used in the training)
--Try updating view with below query and see if the product table also gets updated.
--Update query:
--UPDATE updatable_products SET unit_price = unit_price * 1.1 WHERE units_in_stock < 10;
CREATE VIEW vw_updatable_product AS
SELECT
		product_id,
		product_name,
		unit_price,
		units_in_stock,
		discontinued
FROM products
where discontinued = 0
WITH CHECK OPTION;


select * from  vw_updatable_product;

select * from products;

--UPDATE VIEW
UPDATE vw_updatable_product
SET unit_price = unit_price * 1.1
WHERE units_in_stock < 10;
		
select * from products order by product_id;


--2. Transaction:
--Update the product price for products by 10% in category id=2
--Try COMMIT and ROLLBACK and observe what happens.
SELECT * FROM PRODUCTS WHERE category_id = 2;
BEGIN;
UPDATE products
SET unit_price = unit_price * 1.10
WHERE category_id = 2;
SELECT product_id, product_name, unit_price, category_id
FROM products
WHERE category_id = 2;
COMMIT;
ROLLBACK;

--3.Create a regular view which will have below details (Need to do joins):
--Employee_id,
--Employee_full_name,
--Title,
--Territory_id,
--territory_description,
--region_description 
CREATE VIEW vw_employee_territory_details AS
SELECT
    e.employee_id,
    CONCAT(e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name) AS employee_full_name,
    e.title,
    t.territory_id,
    t.territory_description,
    r.region_description
FROM employees e
JOIN employee_territories et ON e.employee_id = et.employee_id
JOIN territories t ON et.territory_id = t.territory_id
JOIN region r ON t.region_id = r.region_id;

--4.Create a recursive CTE based on Employee Hierarchy
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    --Top-level managers
    SELECT
        employee_id,
        first_name,
        last_name,
        title,
        reports_to,
        1 AS level,
        CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS hierarchy
    FROM employees
    WHERE reports_to IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    -- Recursive member: Employees reporting to others
    SELECT
        e.employee_id,
        e.first_name,
        e.last_name,
        e.title,
        e.reports_to,
        eh.level + 1,
        CONCAT(eh.hierarchy, ' > ', e.first_name, ' ', e.last_name)
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.reports_to = eh.employee_id
)
SELECT *
FROM employee_hierarchy
ORDER BY hierarchy;
